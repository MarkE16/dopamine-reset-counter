      <h3>What is "Dopamine"?</h3>
        <p>
          Dopamine is a neurotransmitter in the brain that is responsible for the rewards center and how we feel pleasure and motivated.<br>
          Dopamine is helpful for us to feel motivated and happy to get our tasks done and feel good about the small things in life. However, too much
          dopamine can be harmful as it can make the brain "desensitized" thus making it harder to feel pleasure and motivation. This in turn can lead to
          depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues.<br>
          This has become a problem in today's society as we are constantly bombarded with social media, video games, TV/movies, and even worse, drugs, that can
          lead to many forms of addictions. This is why it is important to take a break from technology and avoid drugs to help reset our dopamine levels.

      <h3>What is the purpose of this site?</h3>
      <p>
        The purpose of this site is to allow yourself to help give your brain a "rest" by looking at a blank screen and doing absolutely <strong>nothing</strong>,
        as in staring at a blank screen and not moving the mouse or messing with the keyboard for a certain period of time. By doing this, you will allow your brain
        to "recover" from all the dopamine received from high stimulating activity. This site can also be used to challenge yourself to see how long you can go when
        doing nothing.<br>
        <strong>
          Please do note that this site should not be used as a replacement for professional help. If you are currently suffering from mental health problems or any sort
          of addiction, please seek professional help. Please also take note that this will not immediately recover your dopamine levels; it will take time depending on
          how severe it is. (I went through a dopamine recovery and it took about a year and a half to go back to normal, but it varies.)
