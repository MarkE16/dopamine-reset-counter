## What is this?
Dopamine Reset Counter is a web app that allows you to
"reset" your dopamine levels by staring at a blank colorless
screen while doing nothing as a timer counts down.

## What is the point of this?
In today's world, we are constantly bombarded with
high stimulating activity such as social media, video games,
TV/Movies, and lots of other things that cause damage to our
dopamine levels in the brain. This creates a problem where
we become less motivated to do small tasks and feel less
pleasure for the small things in life. While this app is
not designed to fully cure this problem, it can help create
a habit where you give your brain a break from all the
stimulation and help feel pleasure again :)

## Who should use this?
While it's aimed for people who may have an addiction
from something like social media, has a mental health
problem, or technology has started to take over their
life, anyone can use this app for fun or to challenge
themselves to see how long they can go while doing
nothing.

### IMPORTANT NOTICE; PLEASE READ
Please do note that if you're suffering from addiction or
mental health problems that could potentially be related
to dopamine, do not use this app as a replacement for
professional help. Professional help can get you out
of the problem much faster and more effectively than
this small app that was built by a high school senior/college 
freshman.
